## Submission Instructions

### Overview

This project will allow users to build a Warhammer 40k Army list using Pitch battle points on the web.
It will start off with only a single detachment but additional attachments will be added, along with the ability to
add multiple detachments to a full army list.

### Features
•	Select army from list: This will allow the user to select any of the armies in the game and allow the user to
create a name for their army.
•	Select units for a detachment: This will allow users to select available units from a database base off
of the army select and the unit type.
•	Add multiple units to the detachment: This will allow users to build a complete army for the selected
army database.
•	Track points per unit and over all detachment: This will provide the user with information on the overall
point cost of each unit and the over all point cost for the detachment.

### Technologies

•	Java
•	Spring Boot
•	MySQL
•	Thymeleaf templates
•	Bootstrap

### What I'll Have to Learn

I will have to learn more about Bootstrap to be able to organize the layout of my page to look more appealing.
I will also be looking into a possible way to tie in the new database creation of the detachment
to a session key so as to not always have to save the army list.
